Hey, I am Yalcin. I am currently pursuing my degree Bsc. in Chemistry at Ghent University. My experience on Python is mostly through school related assignments.

I have used Python in our 'Programming' course. Here we started from very basics, and expanded our knowledge all the way up to OOP through intense weekly assignments.

After building a strong foundation, I worked on the following projects;

1-) Electric Surface Potential (ESP) Calculations Around a Conductor:
Using Python, I calculated the Electric Surface Potential (ESP) in and around an arbitrary conductor, visualizing the distribution of charges and potential gradients. This project helped in understanding electrostatic interactions and was implemented using NumPy and Matplotlib for visualization.


2-) Visualization of Thermodynamic Properties (NIST Data):
For this project, I used the NIST database to model and visualize the temperature dependence of thermodynamic properties (like enthalpy and entropy) of water and methanol. I used Python to extract data and generate insightful visual plots, helping me explore the phase behavior and thermal properties of these substances.


3-) Phase Diagram for a Phenanthrene-Naphthalene System:
I generated a phase diagram for a binary system of phenanthrene and naphthalene. This involved computational methods to model the phase behavior of the mixture at different temperatures and compositions, helping to visualize phase transitions using Matplotlib.
